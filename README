Description:  After much pulling of hair and late nights I started making good progress on using eBay's API with ColdFusion and figured it was only fair to share.  I didn't find too much direct help when writing these, but without blog posts from Ben Nadel and insights from Ray Camden, this wouldn't be possible.

My goal here is not to provide 100% parsed results and not enabled 100% of the options available.  

My goal is to provide other programmers with a starting point for working with the eBay API
