Description:  After much pulling of hair and late nights I started making good progress on using eBay's API with ColdFusion and figured it was only fair to share.  I didn't find too much direct help when writing these, but without blog posts from Ben Nadel and insights from Ray Camden, this wouldn't be possible.

My goal here is not to provide 100% parsed results and not enabled 100% of the options available.  

My goal is to provide other programmers with a starting point for working with the eBay API

(send to git: git push -u origin master)

API Calls
---------
ebay_getebayofficetime.cfm --- the Hello World of dealing with the eBay API

ebay_getcategories --- Pulls the categories from eBay, remove CategoryParent to pull all categories, be warned it is a large return packet

ebay_additem.cfm --- Creates a new item, verifies that the listing is valid and if valid posts the item to eBay's site for sale, there are a ton of options for the AddItem / VerifyAddItem requests, please read the documentation to add what you need.  What I have provided is a very basic eBay auction, however it should get you over the hump.
